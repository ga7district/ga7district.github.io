    "description": "Hospice of Northeast Georgia Medical Center (NGMC) is changing the way our community understands end-of-life care — from home-based hospice to the region’s first freestanding Hospice House, now under construction in Gainesville. As a Level 5 We Honor Veterans Partner and recipient of the Hospice Honors Elite award (placing it among the nation’s top 5% of hospices), Hospice of NGMC is built on a promise: compassionate, patient-centered care for everyone, regardless of ability to pay. In this presentation, Dr. Mary Keith will explain what hospice and palliative care truly mean, why these services matter long before the final days, and how NGMC’s expanding programs — including the upcoming Hospice House — offer peace, comfort and connection for patients and families. If you would like to attend on zoom, please register via the registration button. An email will be sent prior to the seminar with a zoom link. 230 E.E.
